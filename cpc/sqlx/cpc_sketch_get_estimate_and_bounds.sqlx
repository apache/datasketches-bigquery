CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ${self()}(sketch BYTES, num_std_devs BYTEINT)
RETURNS STRUCT<estimate FLOAT64, lower_bound FLOAT64, upper_bound FLOAT64>
OPTIONS (
  description = '''Gets cardinality estimate and bounds from given sketch.
  
Param sketch: The given sketch to query as bytes.
Param num_std_devs: The returned bounds will be based on the statistical confidence interval determined by the given number of standard deviations
  from the returned estimate. This number may be one of {1,2,3}, where 1 represents 68% confidence, 2 represents 95% confidence and 3 represents 99.7% confidence.
  For example, if the given num_std_devs = 2 and the returned values are {1000, 990, 1010} that means that with 95% confidence, the true value lies within the range [990, 1010].
Defaults: seed = 9001.
Returns: a STRUCT with 3 FLOAT64 values as {estimate, lower_bound, upper_bound}.
