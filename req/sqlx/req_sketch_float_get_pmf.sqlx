  description = '''Returns an approximation to the Probability Mass Function (PMF)
of the input stream as an array of probability masses defined by the given split_points.

Param sketch: the given sketch as BYTES.

Param split_points: an array of M unique, monotonically increasing values 
  (of the same type as the input values)
  that divide the input value domain into M+1 non-overlapping intervals.
  
  Each interval except for the end intervals starts with a split-point and ends with the next split-point in sequence.

  The first interval starts below the minimum value of the stream (corresponding to a zero rank or zero probability), 
  and ends with the first split-point

  The last (m+1)th interval starts with the last split-point 
  and ends above the maximum value of the stream (corresponding to a rank or probability of 1.0).

Param inclusive: if true and the upper boundary of an interval equals a value retained by the sketch, the interval will include that value. 
  If the lower boundary of an interval equals a value retained by the sketch, the interval will exclude that value.

  If false and the upper boundary of an interval equals a value retained by the sketch, the interval will exclude that value. 
  If the lower boundary of an interval equals a value retained by the sketch, the interval will include that value.

Returns: the PMF as a FLOAT64 array of M+1 probability masses on the interval [0.0, 1.0].
  The sum of the probability masses of all (m+1) intervals is 1.0.
