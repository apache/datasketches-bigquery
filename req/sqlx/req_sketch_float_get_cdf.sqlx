  description = '''Returns an approximation to the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) 
of the input stream as an array of cumulative probabilities defined by the given split_points.

Param sketch: the given sketch as BYTES.

Param split_points: an array of M unique, monotonically increasing values
  (of the same type as the input values to the sketch)
  that divide the input value domain into M+1 overlapping intervals.
  
  The start of each interval is below the lowest input value retained by the sketch
  (corresponding to a zero rank or zero probability).
  
  The end of each interval is the associated split-point except for the top interval
  where the end is the maximum input value of the stream.

Param inclusive: if true and the upper boundary of an interval equals a value retained by the sketch, the interval will include that value. 
  If the lower boundary of an interval equals a value retained by the sketch, the interval will exclude that value.

  If false and the upper boundary of an interval equals a value retained by the sketch, the interval will exclude that value. 
  If the lower boundary of an interval equals a value retained by the sketch, the interval will include that value.

Returns: the CDF as a monotonically increasing FLOAT64 array of M+1 cumulative probablities on the interval [0.0, 1.0].
  The top-most probability of the returned array is always 1.0.
