CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ${self()}(sketch BYTES, num_std_devs BYTEINT, seed INT64)
RETURNS STRUCT<sum_estimate FLOAT64, sum_lower_bound FLOAT64, sum_upper_bound FLOAT64>

OPTIONS (
  library=["gs://$GCS_BUCKET/tuple_sketch_int64.js"],

  description = '''Returns the estimate and bounds for the sum of the INT64 summary column
scaled to the original population from the given Tuple Sketch.
Note that cardinality estimation accuracy, plots, and error tables are the same as the Theta Sketch.
This function only applies to Tuple Sketches with an INT64 summary column.

Param sketch: the given Tuple Sketch. This may not be NULL.
Param num_std_devs: The returned bounds will be based on the statistical confidence interval
  determined by the given number of standard deviations from the returned estimate.
  This number may be one of {1,2,3}, where 1 represents 68% confidence,
  2 represents 95% confidence and 3 represents 99.7% confidence.
  For example, if the given num_std_devs = 2 and the returned values are {1000, 990, 1010}
  that means that with 95% confidence, the true value lies within the range [990, 1010].
Param seed: This is used to confirm that the given sketches were configured with the correct seed. A NULL specifies the default seed = 9001.
Returns: a STRUCT with three FLOAT64 values as {sum_estimate, sum_lower_bound, sum_upper_bound}.
