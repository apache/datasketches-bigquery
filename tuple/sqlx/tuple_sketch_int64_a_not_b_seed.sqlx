  description = '''Computes a sketch that represents the scalar set difference of sketchA and not sketchB.
Note that cardinality estimation accuracy, plots, and error tables are the same as the Theta Sketch.
This function only applies to Tuple Sketches with an INT64 summary column.

Param sketchA: the first sketch "A" as BYTES. This may not be NULL.
Param sketchB: the second sketch "B" as BYTES. This may not be NULL.
Param seed: This is used to confirm that the given sketches were configured with the correct seed. A NULL specifies the default seed = 9001.
Returns: a Compact Tuple Sketch as BYTES.
