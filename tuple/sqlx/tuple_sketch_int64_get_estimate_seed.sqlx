Note that cardinality estimation accuracy, plots, and error tables are the same as the Theta Sketch.
This function only applies to Tuple Sketches with an INT64 summary column.
  
Param sketch: the given Tuple Sketch. This may not be NULL.
Param seed: This is used to confirm that the given sketches were configured with the correct seed. A NULL specifies the default seed = 9001.
Returns: the cardinality estimate of the given Tuple Sketch
