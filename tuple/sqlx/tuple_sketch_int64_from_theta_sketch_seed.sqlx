  description = '''Converts the given Theta Sketch into a Tuple Sketch with a INT64 summary column set to the given INT64 value.
Note that cardinality estimation accuracy, plots, and error tables are the same as the Theta Sketch.

Param sketch: the given Theta Sketch. This may not be NULL.
Param value: the given INT64 value. This may not be NULL.
Param seed: This is used to confirm that the given sketches were configured with the correct seed. A NULL specifies the default seed = 9001.
Returns: a Tuple Sketch with an INT64 summary column as BYTES.
