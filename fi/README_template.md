# Apache DataSketches Frequent Items Sketches for Google BigQuery

Frequent Items (FI) sketches are used to estimate the
frequencies of items in a dataset. They are effective for identifying the most
frequent items, such as the top products purchased or the most popular search
queries.

Please visit 
[Frequent Items Sketches](https://datasketches.apache.org/docs/Frequency/FrequencySketches.html)
