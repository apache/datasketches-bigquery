given an error_type and a threshold.

Param sketch: the given sketch as sketch encoded bytes.
Param error_type: determines whether no false positives or no false negatives are desired.
Param threshold: a threshold to include items in the result list.
If NULL, the maximum error of the sketch is used as a threshold.
Returns: an array of frequent items with frequency estimates, lower and upper bounds.
